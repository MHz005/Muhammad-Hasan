# Rossmann Store Sales Prediction using Gradient Boosting

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting daily sales for Rossmann retail stores using machine learning techniques. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for inventory management, staffing, and promotional planning, making this problem highly relevant in real-world retail operations.

## Problem Statement
Rossmann operates thousands of stores across multiple regions, each influenced by factors such as promotions, holidays, store type, and competition. The challenge is to predict future daily sales for individual stores based on historical data and contextual features.

## Approach
- **Data:** Publicly available Rossmann Store Sales dataset from Kaggle, including historical sales, promotions, holidays, and store metadata.  
- **Model:** Gradient Boosting regression model to capture non-linear relationships in the data.  
- **Techniques Used:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Feature engineering (promotions, holidays, store attributes)  
  - Train-validation split  
  - Model training and performance evaluation  

## Results
The Gradient Boosting model demonstrated strong predictive performance, effectively capturing sales patterns and seasonal trends. The results highlight the model’s ability to generalize well across different stores and time periods.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab
